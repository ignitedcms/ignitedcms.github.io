        The UK has a funny old view on escooters, which I happen to think is unreasonable.
        Here's the thing, you're technically allowed to own an escooter, it is just you can't
        ride them in public. Now given a choice, over an electric bike and and escooter, sometimes
        it just makes sense to use an escooter. One, they are way more portable, compact, cheaper
        and easier to maintain. It makes no sense to allow electric bikes, but not escooters. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In fact, during the pandemic a lot of nurses and junior doctors who were using escooters to
        commute to work were fined.
        <br>
        <br>
        Escooters are the perfect item to take on a train journey too, it is ironic that electric bikes
        are permitted but not escooters. Maybe it is just that the public image regarding escooters is one of being
        a nusicance to society. I can understand that, the amount of people ignoring the rules and riding
        recklessly on pavements. But honestly, the same can be said for electric bikes. I would love
        to own an escooter again, but the risks you take on getting points on your driving license and confiscation 
        is just not worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now onto coffee shops. This is a bit of a grim observation. But as I commute through town these days
        I see so many premises closing down - going into administration. These are mainly clothing outlets or other
        similar retail stores. But the humble coffee shop, in general seems to be doing quite well.

        <br>
        <br>
        I guess the take-away is there will always be business for small food or beverage suppliers, people
        will always buy something they tend to consume on a regular basis.
