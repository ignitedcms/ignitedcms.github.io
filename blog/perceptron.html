          Sometimes I like to look back at my university days. At the time,
          I was fortunate to be able to even go to uni. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I remember being super excited at my uni third year thesis project.
          That being, 'Simulating spiking neurons in the brain using FPGAs.'
          <br>
          <br>
          Now at the time, not much was known about AI. A lot of the theories
          was very much in the air. My university professor, head of the software
          engineering department was investigating how the brain signals can be 
          modelled using common hardware. I suppose the reasoning behind this, is
          when you want to try and model something, nature is a good place to start.
          <br>
          <br>
          It was believed at the time trying to accurately model the 'activation function'
          in the brain using low level hardware, that being FPGAs, or essentially logic gates
          was a good place to start.
          <br>
          <br>
          I remember so many fond memories. Sitting in the university library, with
          old books lined across the shelves, some with complex high level mathematics.
          In particular, was the model of the perceptron by Minsky.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the book he describes how a perceptron takes some arbitary number of inputs
          and given some criteria it either fires an activation function or not.
          I can't remember the details too well, but I remember that the most important
          thing, in all of this is the 'weights.' That is how the perceptron learns.
          <br>
          <br>
          Of course, this was a long while back, we had GPUs but not as we know them today.
          I can understand why low level CPUs seemed like the obvious means of study and
          scientific investigation.
          <br>
          <br>
          The funny thing is, this exact idea, the idea of the 'perceptron'
          is probably no different to the AI models of today. The only difference, is back
          then we didn't have the scale or the power. So any advancements, weren't large 
          enough to make any scientific breakthroughs.
          <br>
          <br>
          We had the keys, already present to us back then, just not the technology.
          <br>
          <br>
          I probably missing something of course, for example
         I not entirely sure how LLMs do next token prediction, but that is how I understand it.
         And that is kinda fascinating
